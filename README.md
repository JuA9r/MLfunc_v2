## **Overview**
The research is motivated by wave propagation in complex, non-uniform environments, such as the seismically active crust of the Tokara Islands.
**Non-locality and Memory Effects**: Fractional derivatives incorporate historical dependency and non-local interactions, allowing for the accurate description of frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion in disordered media.
**Anomalous Diffusion**: This model accounts for "Lévy flights," where particles occasionally undergo very large displacements, leading to super-diffusive behavior.
